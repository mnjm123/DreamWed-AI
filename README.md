# 💍 DreamWed AI  

DreamWed AI is a generative AI-powered wedding planning assistant, built on **Base44** and **OpenAI GPT APIs**.  
It creates **personalized wedding budgets, venue suggestions, and recommendations** directly from a single inspirational image upload.  

---

## 🚀 What It Does  
- 📸 **Image Upload → Wedding Plan**: Users can upload an inspirational wedding image.  
- 💡 **AI Analysis**: Base44 + GPT APIs interpret the style, estimated guest size, and location context.  
- 📊 **Structured Output**: Generates a personalized budget breakdown, venue suggestions, and planning notes.  
- 📅 **Entity Storage**: Saves results into a `WeddingPlan` schema (Base44 entities), so users can revisit or update their plan later.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Base44** – secure runtime, database entities, InvokeLLM wrapper  
- **OpenAI GPT APIs** – structured generation (JSON + human summary)  
- **JavaScript + Python** – Base44 entity management and API integration  
- **Figma** – UX mockups for agent flows and user experience

## 🔍 How It Works (Simplified Flow)  
1. **Form inputs or image upload** → sent to Base44  
2. **Base44 InvokeLLM** → securely calls OpenAI API  
3. **Structured output** → JSON with budget, recommendations, and summary  
4. **Saved into WeddingPlan entity** → visible in the app UI

- Identify the right venues/vendors for their needs  
- Save hours of manual research and spreadsheet work

## 👩‍💻 My Role  
- Designed the **business model and use case** (as part of an INSEAD MBA project)  
- Built the **agent prototype** using Base44 + GPT APIs  
- Created structured prompts and iterated with real scenarios ($25k, 120-guest wedding in Denver)  
- Refined UX flows (budget tables, venue cards, email copy) through multiple test rounds
